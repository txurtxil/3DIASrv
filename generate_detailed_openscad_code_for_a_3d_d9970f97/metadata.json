  "prompt": "Generate detailed OpenSCAD code for a 3D printable model of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Make it highly accurate with the iron lattice structure, four legs, three observation levels, arches, and the antenna on top. Scale the entire model to a maximum height of 170 mm (base width around 100-120 mm) to fit within a 180x180x180 mm build volume for a Bambu Lab A1 Mini printer. Optimize for 3D printing: use solid base for stability, minimize overhangs to reduce supports, and ensure it's manifold. Include comments in the code explaining key parts. Output only the complete OpenSCAD script.",

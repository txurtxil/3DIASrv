  "prompt": "Generate a 3D model of the Eiffel Tower with exact bounding box dimensions of 50mm width, 50mm depth, and 80mm height. The model must be a realistic, high-detail representation, capturing the intricate wrought-iron lattice, the four structural arches at the base, and the tapering silhouette. Ensure the model is manifold and optimized for 3D printing.\"",
